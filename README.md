I initially developed every logic in the paint app from scratch, including not just the line drawing but also other essential features. For example, I created custom logic for shapes like rectangles, circles, and freehand drawing. However, after consulting ChatGPT, it suggested using built-in components for these features to enhance performance and speed. Following that advice, I implemented the app using built-in tools, which made the app more efficient while retaining all the necessary functionalities.
